/**
 Name: Aguilar, Aaron Kyle M.
 Date: October 31, 2022
 Activity Name: MoneyInBank

 Problem:
 Below is the MoneyInBank program that needs to be improved
 as specified on page 9 of module4_112~.pdf.

 The improved program should be included in midterm.activities package.

 Input: opNumber, principal, and year
 Process:
 showIntroduction method
 Use a while loop on the user input
 try class was used to catch the invalid inputs of the user
 Prints out the box that shows the decision.
 User then will input the number corresponding to the program
 switch case is use here and inside the case is the program makeADeposit, withdrawAccount, and showData methods and quit the application command line
 Use the formula in the Initial moneyInBank.java program for method 3.
 Keep looping until the user wants to quit the program.
 Output: Final amount, balance, and etc.
