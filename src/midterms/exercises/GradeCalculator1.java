     Name of Exercise: Midterm Demo Program 1

     OBJECTIVE:
     Create a program that has a method that is invoked by the main method


     Create a program that computes and displays the grade that is corresponding
     to a given score based on the following specifications:

     The grade is the integer value of (rawScore/perfectScore * 50 +50 )

     The perfectScore is an input by the program user at runtime.
     The perfectScore should be validated such that a perfectScore that is
     0 or negative should let the program user re-enter a valid perfectScore.

     The rawScore is an input by the program user at runtime.
     The rawScore should be validated such that a rawScore that is greater than the
     perfectScore should let the program user re-enter a valid rawScore.
     In addition, a rawScore that is less than 0 should let the program user
     re-enter a valid rawScore.

     The program execution will stop only if the user answers no to the question
     Do you want to compute another grade<Yes/No> ?

     Sample Run:


     Enter the perfect score: 0
     The perfect score should be greater than 0. Please enter a valid perfect score

     Enter the perfect score: 100

     Enter a raw score:   101

     The raw score cannot be higher than the perfect score.
     Please enter a valid raw score.

     Enter a raw score: -5

     The raw score cannot be lower than 0.
     Please enter a valid raw score.

     The raw score cannot be higher than the perfect score.
     Please enter a valid raw score. 90

     Grade = 95

     Do you want to compute another grade<Yes/No>: Yes

     Enter the perfect score: 10
     Enter a raw score:   5

     Grade = 95

     Do you want to compute another grade<Yes/No>: No
